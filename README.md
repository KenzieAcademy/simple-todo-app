# Assessment: Simple Todo Application

For this assessment, we'd like you to create a simple todo application. In the
course of completing this assessment, you'll have to demonstrate a minimal
understanding of the following:
    - ES6 class syntax
    - defining and passing props to components
    - maintaining internal component state
    - using `Array.prototype.map` to iterate over values to be rendered as
      part of HTML

## Getting Started

To get started, _fork_ this repository into your own GitHub account then clone
this repository to your local machine:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ git clone git@github.com:github-username/simple-todo-app
foo@bar:~ $ cd simple-todo-app
foo@bar:~/simple-todo-app $
```

Note `github-username` above. In other words, *don't* simply copy-paste the
code above blindly into a terminal. 

Once you have this code on your machine, you'll need to install project
dependencies:

```console
foo@bar:~/simple-todo-app $ yarn
```

Note the use of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) here, which you should have
installed previously. While `npm` would have worked (e.g., `npm install`),
`yarn` caches dependencies between projects, which should make installation of
said dependencies happen faster.

Finally, you can start the scaffold application, which should open a browser
window for you automatically:

```console
foo@bar:~/simple-todo-app $ yarn start
```
